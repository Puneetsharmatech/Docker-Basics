Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure your application services in a docker-compose.yml file, making it easier to deploy and manage complex applications.

Here are the main commands you can use with Docker Compose:

Common Docker Compose Commands
docker-compose up
Starts the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Flags:
-d: Run in detached mode (in the background).
--build: Build images before starting the containers.
--force-recreate: Recreate containers even if their configuration hasnâ€™t changed.
--remove-orphans: Remove containers for services not defined in the Compose file.
docker-compose down
Stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose up.
Flags:
--volumes: Remove named volumes declared in the volumes section of the Compose file.
--remove-orphans: Remove containers for services not defined in the Compose file.
docker-compose ps
Lists the containers managed by the current docker-compose project.
Flags:
-q: Only display container IDs.
docker-compose build
Builds or rebuilds services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
