Docker is a platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers.
Containers are lightweight, portable, and contain everything needed to run a piece of software,
including the code, libraries, and dependencies. This means you can easily move applications between
different environments without worrying about compatibility issues.

The main difference between Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) is how they operate.

Containers share the host systemâ€™s operating system kernel, which makes them much more efficient
and faster to start up. They are like lightweight boxes that can run multiple applications on the 
same OS.

Virtual Machines, on the other hand, include a full operating system along with the application. 
Each VM runs on its own virtualized hardware, which makes them heavier and slower to boot.
